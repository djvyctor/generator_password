🔐 Password Manager App

Hey! Looking for a tool that's both simple and powerful?

I have a solution!!! 🚀

I'm starting the process of creating a simple Python app. When you run it, it will ask for your master password to grant access.

## ⚡ Features

Based on that, this app will have features like:

🛠 Generating complex passwords based on the character length you choose.

💾 Storing passwords for various apps or websites you use, including the link to go directly to the site or app.

⚠️ Warning you if you overuse the same password in different places, suggesting you change it.

Each password will also have an expiration date. But don't worry, your password won't just disappear or change out of the blue!
The app will simply advise you to change it on the website where it's used, so you can have better security.

## 🛡️ Goal

Our main concern is to maintain a safe and stress-free environment on your desktop.

Follow along with the project until its official release version =)

Thanks!!! 🙌
